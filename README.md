# Python vs Rust Bitcoin CSV Processor

## Overview

This project is a performance comparison between Python and Rust for processing a Bitcoin price dataset stored in a CSV file and extracting the top 10 closing prices. The goal is to evaluate the performance, resource usage, and coding convenience of both languages in this specific data processing task.

## Introduction

Choosing the right programming language for data processing tasks can significantly impact efficiency and performance. Python is known for its simplicity and rich ecosystem, while Rust offers performance and memory safety. This project analyzes their performance in processing a Bitcoin price dataset.

## Getting Started

Before comparing Python and Rust, you need to set up your development environment. Here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

To run the code and benchmarks, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 
- Rust (ensure you have Cargo, Rust's package manager, installed)


### RESULTS

After running the same script on Python and Rust, these were the results obtained:
